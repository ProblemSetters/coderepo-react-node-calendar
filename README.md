# Calendar

Calendar is a full-stack scheduling workspace for people who need one place to plan their own time and coordinate with a team. It combines personal calendars, shared availability, meeting planning, invitation responses, search, and daily time insights in a single product.

The React interface uses the Express API for every product data flow. MongoDB is the source of truth for workspace accounts, profiles, calendars, events, guest responses, availability, and insights.

## Product capabilities

### Workspace access and navigation

- Sign in with a seeded workspace account, switch between profiles, resume a session, and sign out.
- Move between day, week, and month views using period controls, the mini calendar, Today, or keyboard shortcuts.

### Calendar and event management

- Create, view, edit, and delete events, tasks, focus time, out-of-office blocks, working locations, and appointment schedules.
- Schedule timed or all-day items with a calendar, color, location, description, guests, and recurring rules.
- Create, rename, recolor, show, hide, display exclusively, and delete empty calendars.

### Availability and collaboration

- Find coworkers, compare schedules and working hours, detect conflicts, and choose suggested meeting times.
- Review guest details and respond to invitations with Yes, Maybe, or No.

### Search and time insights

- Search by keywords, participant, location, calendar scope, excluded text, or date range.
- Review daily scheduled and remaining time by item type or calendar, then create a focus-time block.

Frontend and backend code are organized by the same product domains. Backend routes delegate HTTP handling to controllers, business rules to services, and database operations to repositories.

## Run the application

### Prerequisites

- Bun
- MongoDB Community Server

`bun start` checks MongoDB and attempts to start a local instance when needed. If startup reports that MongoDB is unreachable, start the installed service manually:

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| macOS with Homebrew | `brew services start mongodb-community` |
| Linux with systemd | `sudo systemctl start mongod` |
| Windows service | Run `net start MongoDB` from Command Prompt as Administrator. |

To verify the local connection manually:

```bash
mongosh "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017" --eval "db.runCommand({ ping: 1 })"
```

### Install and start

From the repository root:

```bash
bun install
bun start
```

After startup:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:8000`
- API health: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`

HackerRank uses `bun install && bash setup.sh --seed` for installation and `bun start` for the complete application run flow.

### Command reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bun install` | Installs the pinned root, frontend, and backend workspaces from `bun.lock`. |
| `bun start` | Creates missing environment files, verifies MongoDB, resets seed data, and starts frontend and backend together. |
| `bun run seed` | Clears the application collections and restores the deterministic seed baseline without starting the servers. |
| `bun run dev:backend` | Starts only the Express API on port `8000` with Bun watch mode. Use it when working only on backend behavior. |
| `bun run dev:frontend` | Starts only Vite on port `3000`. Use it when the backend is already running separately. |

## Demo workspace

Use the seeded Alex Morgan account:

```text
Email: alex.morgan@calendar.com
Password: password123
```

After login, choose any seeded profile to open that person's calendar.

## Create and validate a Code Repo application

This repository includes an internal authoring guideline and a read-only validation skill for maintainers creating complete Code Repo applications.

### While creating an application

Use the [HackerRank Code Repo Guidelines](docs/HackerRank-Code-Repo-Guidelines.md) as the acceptance contract. It explains product completeness, stack preservation, dependency restrictions, repository structure, HackerRank runtime behavior, README requirements, and evidence needed for completion.

Write the new application's README as its product contract. Document features that are implemented across frontend, API, and persistence, and describe the actual stack and commands used by that repository.

### After implementation is complete

Open the repository in Codex or Claude Code and use this prompt:

```text
Read and follow skills/code-repo-validate/SKILL.md to validate this complete Code Repo application against docs/HackerRank-Code-Repo-Guidelines.md. Run the in-scope static, install, build, start, API, and MongoDB checks, then write the report outside the repository.
```

The validator first applies the required README gate, then checks repository structure, stack and dependency consistency, declared commands, frontend-to-backend feature coverage, live API behavior, persistence, seed reset, and archive contents. It never creates missing documentation or repairs the repository during the audit.

See the [validation manual](skills/code-repo-validate/SKILL-MANUAL.md) for adoption, invocation, verdict meanings, and the rerun workflow.
